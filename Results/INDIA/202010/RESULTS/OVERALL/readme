This dir contains scripts & their results to make overall comparison of number of
number of dips vs days in month

Usage of scripts -
* First copy all the CSVs in the cur dir
* Read the specifications mentioned in `final_graph.py`, but don't run it yet
* Then run `./make_final.sh` which will loop over all CSVs & pass it to `final_graph.py` for further processing
* Finally run `end_graph.py YYYYMM_output.csv` to generate the final graph

The baised folder contains results after removing some outlier from `YYYYMM_output.csv`,
mainly those ISPs that can ruin the disribution & make it very uneven
